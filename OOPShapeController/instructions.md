2. OOP Shape controller 
- create a web UI with buttons (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT)
- UI must contain a canvas of 500x500 pixels
- must be able to select between at least two shapes (Square, circle, triangle, etc)
- must be able to select between at least two coordinate display methods
- the UI must display the coordinate position somewhere and be updated as the changes occur 
- when the buttons are pressed, actions will be queued that will move the shape in the specified direction
- the actions created will only take effect after a debounce time
    - all actions must be executed in order, one after the other with some delay per action
- create classes to represent the necessary entities to:
  - shapes
      - position
      - actions
      - time control
      - anything else that comes up
  - focus on OOP design, but incorporate async handling techniques as well (promises, async/await, generators, etc) if possible.
  - add a "compress" option for movements
      - any consecutive movements in the queue that are in the same direction should be done in a single move
      - the compress option should be optional through a checkbox
